Project Structure:

The project is organized into three main folders:

common: This folder contains shared CSS and JavaScript code used across both pages.
features: Within this folder, you'll find the code for the two pages: the landing page and the survey page. Each page has its own folder. Inside each page's folder:
controller: Holds the JavaScript specific to that page.
css: Contains three files: one for animations, one for media queries, and one for general styling unique to that page.
images: This folder stores all the SVGs and images used in the project.
Technology Used:

For this project, I relied solely on HTML, HTML5, CSS, CSS3, and JavaScript without incorporating any third-party libraries.
